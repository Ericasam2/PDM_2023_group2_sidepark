### Simulation
The simulation is based on the [KinematicBicycleModel](https://github.com/winstxnhdw/KinematicBicycleModel/tree/main).

The obstacles the simulation uses are stored in the `PDM_2023_group2_sidepark\KinematicBicycleModel\data\static_obstacles.csv` file.

#### Requirement:
All the requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.


### How to run it:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ericasam2/PDM_2023_group2_sidepark.git
```
2. Run the python file from the `KinematicBicycleModel` repository
```bash
cd KinematicBicycleModel
python animate.py
```
